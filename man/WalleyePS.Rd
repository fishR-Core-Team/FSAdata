\title{Ages of Walleye assigned from otoliths, scales, and spines.}
\format{
A data frame with 61 observations on the following 4 variables:
 \describe{
   \item{otolith}{Age (years) assigned from broken, ground, and polished otolith sections} 
   \item{spine}{Age (years) assigned from dorsal spine sections}
   \item{scale}{Age (years) assigned from scale impressions}
   \item{sex}{Sex of fish (\code{female} and \code{male})}
 }
}
\source{
From Figure 2 in Kocovsky, P.M., and R.M. Carline. 2000. A comparison of methods for estimating ages of unexploited walleyes. North American Journal of Fisheries Management 20:1044-1048.
}
\description{
Age of Pymatuning Sanctuary (PA) Walleye (\emph{Sander vitreus}) assessed from three calcified structures -- sectioned otoliths, sectioned dorsal spines, and scale impressions.
}
\note{
Relationships between otoliths and spines and otoliths and scales are exact according to Figure 2.  Relationship between spines and scales is approximate as Figure 2 did not show this exact relationship.
