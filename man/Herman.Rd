\description{

\details{
Lake Herman was sampled on June 20-22, 2005 with four overnight gillnet sets and 10 overnight trapnet sets. The trapnets were constructed with 19-mm (0.75 in) bar-mesh netting, 0.9 m high x 1.5 m wide (3 ft high x 5 ft wide) frames and 18.3 m (60 ft) long leads. The gillnets were 45.7 m long x 1.8 m deep (150 ft long x 6 ft deep) with one 7.6 m (25 ft) panel each of 13, 19, 25, 32, 38 and 51-mm (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, and 2 in) bar-mesh monofilament netting.
