\title{Catches in removal events of Brown and Rainbow Trout at various locations.}
\format{
A data frame of 40 observations on the following 10 variables:
 \describe{
   \item{species}{Species of trout (\code{brown} or \code{rainbow}).}
   \item{site}{Site in the watershed.  See source.}
   \item{age0}{Logical is \code{TRUE} if age-0 and \code{FALSE} if age is >0.}
   \item{first}{Catch on the first removal pass.}
   \item{second}{Catch on the second removal pass.}
   \item{third}{Catch on the third removal pass.}
   \item{pop.cs}{Population estimate by Carle-Strub method.}
   \item{pop.sch}{Population estimate by Schnute method.}
   \item{q.cons}{Logical is \code{TRUE} if catchability was constant.}
   \item{rejected}{Logical is \code{TRUE} if Schnute method rejected the population estimate because the standard error was too large.}
 }
