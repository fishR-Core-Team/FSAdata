\description{
Catch and effort data for Fantail Darter (\emph{Etheostoma flabellare}) from seven removal events conducted by Mahon (1980).
}
\details{
Catch (number of fish) was recorded.  Effort was a constant amount of electrofishing for each sampling event and is, thus, entered as a constant value of 1.

These data are used in many publications because the stream section was rotenoned following the removal surveys to determine a known population size of 1151 individuals.
