\description{
White Shrimp (\emph{Litopenaeus setiferus}) stock and recruitment data from off the coast of Georgia (USA), 1979-2000.
}
\note{
No graph was shown for stock values vs. year so some stock values had to be haphazardly paired with recruit values -- especially for stock values between 2.5 and 3.0.
