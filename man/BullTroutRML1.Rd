\title{Lengths and weights for Bull Trout from two Rocky Mountain lakes and two eras.}
\format{
A data frame with 137 observations on the following 3 variables:
 \describe{
   \item{fl}{Fork length (mm)}
   \item{mass}{Wet mass (g)}
   \item{era}{Era of collection (\code{1977-79} and \code{2001})}
 }
}
\source{
From (approximately) Figure 2 of Parker, B.R., D.W. Schindler, F.M. Wilhelm, and D.B. Donald. 2007. Bull trout population responses to reductions in angler effort and retention limits. North American Journal of Fisheries Management, 27:848-859.

}
\description{
Lengths and weights of Bull Trout (\emph{Salvelinus confluentis}) from two Rocky Mountain lakes in Alberta, CAN and two eras.
}
\note{
The historical (1977-1980) era samples were from before restrictive sportfishing regulatory regimes were implemented (in the 1990s) that led to changes in abundance and population structure of bull trout.
