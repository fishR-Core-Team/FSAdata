\title{Ages (subsample) and lengths (all fish) for Rock Bass from Lake Ontario.}
\format{
A data frame with 1288 observations on the following 2 variables:
 \describe{
   \item{age}{Assigned ages (from scales)}
   \item{tl}{Measured total lengths (mm)}
 }
}

Ages (subsample) and lengths (all fish) for Rock Bass from Lake Ontario.
}
\details{
As many as 10 fish per 10-mm total length intervals from the \code{\link{RockBassLO1}} data.frame was obtained for age assignment.  The remaining fish in the file were only measure for length (i.e., the ages were deleted).  This data file can be used to demonstrate the use of age-length keys.
