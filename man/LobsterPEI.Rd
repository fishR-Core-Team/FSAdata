Catch and effort data for Lobster from 33 days in 1944 from the Tignish area of Prince Edward Island.

\details{
Catch (1000s of pounds) and effort (1000s of traps) of Lobster from 33 days in 1944 from the Tignish area of Prince Edward Island.  The data start on 2-May.  These data are from DeLury (1947) who used the data after 22-May (i.e., day 16) to illustrate his depletion method.  The data were also used in Example 7.1 of Seber (2002).  DeLury (1947) noted that the weight of Lobster did not change appreciably over time so that the poundage caught is a reasonable surrogate for numbers caught.
