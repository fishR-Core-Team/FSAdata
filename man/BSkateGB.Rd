\title{Stock and recruitment data for Barndoor Skate from Georges Bank, 1966-2007.}
\format{
A data frame with 31 observations on the following 4 variables.
 \describe{
   \item{spawners}{a numeric vector giving CPUE of spawning fish}
   \item{recruits}{a numeric vector containing the CPUE of recruits}
   \item{year}{a numeric vector containing the year of the survey (recruits have been properly lagged (3 years) to match with spawners)}
   \item{season}{a factor containing the season of capture (fall, spring, winter)}
 }
}
\source{
Estimated (using digitize) from figures 4-6 in Gedamke, T., J.M. Hoenig, W.D. DuPaul, and J.A. Musick. 2009. Stock-recruitment dynamics and the maximum population growth rate of the barndoor skate on Georges Bank. North American Journal of Fisheries Management 29:512-526.

\description{
Stock and recruitment data for Barndoor Skate (\emph{Dipturus laevis}) from Georges Bank for three seasons.

Only years within each season where more than one spawner and more than one recruit were captured were recorded.  The authors noted that the Beverton-Holt model could NOT be fit to the winter data.
