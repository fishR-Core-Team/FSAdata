## Introduction
The **FSAdata** package, maintained by the [**fishR Core Team**](https://github.com/fishR-Core-Team), contains data for use in common fisheries analyses. **FSAdata** is a companion package to [**FSA**](https://github.com/fishR-Core-Team/FSA). The data and documentation for individual data sets may be viewed and downloaded (as a CSV file) from [the *data* page](http://derekogle.com/fishR/data/) of the [fishR website](http://derekogle.com/fishR).

Examples of typical fisheries stock assessment analyses that use some of these data sets are available on [the *Examples* page](http://derekogle.com/fishR/examples/) of the [fishR website](http://derekogle.com/fishR).

## Installation
The [CRAN version](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FSAdata/index.html) of **FSAdata** may be installed with

The development version may be installed from GitHub with
