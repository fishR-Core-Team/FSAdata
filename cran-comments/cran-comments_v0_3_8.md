* This updates the existing FSAdata package on CRAN with corrections, largely to the use of \concept(), as directed by CRAN (per e-mail from Kurt Hornik on 17-May-19).

## Notes
* There may be a note about "datasets" being misspelled in the description. I do not consider "datasets" to be misspelled.

## Testing Environments
* My Windows machine.
* Win Builder -- current and development.
* Travis-CI.
