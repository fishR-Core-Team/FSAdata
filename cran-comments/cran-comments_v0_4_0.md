* This updates the existing FSAdata package on CRAN with links to external CSV files for each data set and other minor corrections.

## Notes
* There may be a note about a change in maintainers that stems from me (Derek Ogle) updating to a new e-mail address.
* There may be a note about "datasets" being misspelled in the description. I do not consider "datasets" to be misspelled.

## Testing Environments
* My Windows machine.
* Win Builder -- current, development, and old-release.
* GitHub Action (R-CMD-check.yaml)
