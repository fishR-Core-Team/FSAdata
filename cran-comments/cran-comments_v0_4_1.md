* This updates the existing FSAdata package on CRAN by fixing FSAdata-package `\alias` problem with the "manual approach" (i.e., adding a specific `@aliases FSAdata-package` line to `FSAdata.R`) suggested in an e-mail from Kurt Hornik on 19-Aug-2023.

## Notes
* There may be a note about a change in maintainers that stems from me (Derek Ogle) updating to a new e-mail address.
* There may be a note about "datasets" being misspelled in the description. I do not consider "datasets" to be misspelled.

## Testing Environments
* My Windows machine.
* Win Builder -- current, development, and old-release.
* GitHub Action (R-CMD-check.yaml)
