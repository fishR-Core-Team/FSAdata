* This updates the existing FSAdata package on CRAN.

## Notes
* There is a note about "FSA" and "datasets" being misspelled in the description. "FSA" is the name of a package that this package provides datasets for. I do not consider "datasets" to be misspelled.

## Testing Environments
* My Windows machine.
* Win Builder -- current and development.
* Travis-CI.
