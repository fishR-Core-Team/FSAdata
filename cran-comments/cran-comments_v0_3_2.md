* This is a package update. I submitted an update yesterday that was rejected because I used LaTeX quotes in the DESCRIPTION file and because there was a url that timed out. I have fixed the quotes issue. In addition, I removed all uses of \url or \href that referenced web addresses that I do not control.

* Passed both current and development versions on win-builder.
