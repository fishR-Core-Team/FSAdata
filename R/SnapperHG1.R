#' @title Age (subsample) and length (all fish) of Snapper from two survey locations.
#' 
#' @description A large sample (not random or proportional) of Snapper (\emph{Pagrus auratus}) were aged from otoliths, with the remainder of the fish just measured for length. Note that age-20 is actually age 19+.

#' @note The unaged fish were simulated from Table 5 assuming that the total number of fish was large enough that at least one fish was observed in each cell where a  proportion was listed.
