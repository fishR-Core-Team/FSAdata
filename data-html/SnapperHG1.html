<h2>Age (subsample) and length (all fish) of Snapper from two survey locations.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A large sample (not random or proportional) of Snapper (<em>Pagrus auratus</em>) were aged from otoliths, with the remainder of the fish just measured for length.  Note that age-20 is actually age 19+.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame of 18421 observations on the following 3 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li>len: Measured lengths (cm)</li>
<li>age: Ages assigned from examination of otoliths</li>
<li>survey: Survey location (<code>KAH8810</code> or <code>KAH0012</code>)</li>
</ul>
